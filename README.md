vigenereCipher
==============
This is my first repo.

Here we have the beginings of a program that takes in a message from a user and encrypts it using a version of the  Vigenere Cipher called "Tabula Recta." It also allows a user with an encrypted message to decode it. Essentially this is a form of polyalphebetic substitution. You can read about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher 
and here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_recta

The plan for this application is to take it all the way to an Android App. I am new to software dev and am using this project as a way to teach myself how to code.
